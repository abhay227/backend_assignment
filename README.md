 Integrating different social media platform into a single web application

->In this project, I have integrated authentication for four platforms in my web application: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Google.

->I have successfully implemented OAuth authentication for Facebook, Twitter, and Google. However, I encountered challenges while integrating Instagram due to the requirement for a Facebook page connection, and my Facebook account restrictions prevent me from creating additional pages.

->After logging in through Facebook or Google, the application displays a unique user ID as part of the authentication process.

->Additionally, I have implemented functionality to post a tweet using the Twitter API. The button for this feature becomes accessible after logging into the Twitter platform.
